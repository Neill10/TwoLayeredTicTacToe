Two Layer Tic Tac Toe differs in that players can take spaces away from one another. A space can only
be locked if you take it twice. For example, if you put your X on the center square, the other player can
place his or her O on the center square later and take it away from you. If you place a second X on the
center square before your opponent takes it away, youâ€™ve claimed it for good.

//There is only 1 board (9 cells)
